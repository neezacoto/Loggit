# LoggitBotnWebsite

This is a bot and website I made for my freshman Web Development class.
Loggit! allows friends to log their minutes studied using a discord integrated bot called Loggit!.
They provide the minutes studied and a picture of proof to the bot, and the bot will store the information on it's database.
Then users can check out eachothers rankings and scores using the bot, along with other fun tools!
Users also have the option to use the website view, to view an updated leaderboard of the users that are studying.
Each user can be clicked on to view all their entries!

This project uses the discord.js library to operate the bot, and sequalize/postgres for database storage.
