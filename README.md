# LoggitBotnWebsite

This is a bot and website I made for my freshman Web Development class. Loggit! allows friends to log their minutes studied using a discord integrated bot called “Loggit!”. This application utilizes the discord.js library, the Discord API, a frog website’s API, an inspirational quote website’s API, a SQL database, HTML/CSS & Javascript. Users provide the minutes studied and a picture of proof to the bot, and the bot will store the information on it's SQL database. Then users can check out each other's rankings and scores using the bot, along with other fun tools! Users also have the option to use the website view, to view an updated leaderboard of the users that are studying. Each user can be clicked on to view all their entries for that season.
