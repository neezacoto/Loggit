Loggit! allows friends to log their minutes studied using a discord integrated bot called “Loggit!”. This application utilizes the discord.js library, the Discord API, a frog website’s API, an inspirational quote website’s API, a SQL database, HTML/CSS & Javascript. Users provide the minutes studied and a picture of proof to the bot, and the bot will store the information on it's SQL database.
